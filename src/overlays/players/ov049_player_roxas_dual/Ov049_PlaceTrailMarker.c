/* Place a trailing marker in world space (x4: ov049 + 3 twins). Only while bit 0 of the
 * actor's +0x694 flags is set, and only for message kinds 2..5. Take the emitter's base
 * point (ov022_020ad44c) and, unless the message already carries a fixed offset (+0x118),
 * offset it by the constant local vector {-0x6f, 0x1768, 0x29} rotated by the actor's
 * heading. Publish the heading at msg+0x80, raise flag 0x20 and hand the world point in at
 * msg+0xa8.
 *
 * ★ `biased` is the load-bearing spelling and it is also the honest one. The heading is
 * stored as a signed-ish halfword but the sin/cos table is indexed by an UNSIGNED 16-bit
 * angle, so the code works in the biased domain throughout: it converts once, before the
 * call, keeps that, and reconstructs the original for the store with `+ 0x8000`. Reading
 * the raw angle and biasing it later where it is used is one instruction SHORT -- and it
 * hides what the 0x8000 is for. (The two are identical mod 65536, which is why either
 * compiles at all.)
 *
 * The rotation feeds MTX_RotY33_ with NEGATED sin and cos, i.e. it rotates by -heading:
 * the offset is expressed in the actor's local frame and is being brought into world.
 *
 * Case order from tools/switchorder.py: {2,3,4,5} share one body, {0,1} share the
 * default's -- only the first group is written. */
