/* Ov099_RequestSpawnAtObject -- issue a "spawn at the object's position" request. Builds the request
 * descriptor from the object's position (raised by 0x7800), its kind byte and its extension block,
 * builds a second descriptor whose direction vector is either the caller's raw vector or its
 * normalised form, clears the two one-shot bytes, marks it live, and hands the pair to the request
 * queue. Only continues past the queue call when the queue accepted it or the slot byte reads 4,
 * in which case it notifies Ov022_PlayEntityVoice.
 *
 * !! THIS WAS MIS-DIAGNOSED AS A REGISTER-ALLOCATION TIE FOR A LONG TIME. It is not one:
 * VEC_Mag takes ONE argument. The old source called it as
 * `VEC_Mag(r3p, 0x625, obj->ext, kind)` -- four. Because the extern was unprototyped
 * (`extern int VEC_Mag();`) that compiled silently, and the three phantom arguments were exactly
 * enough extra live values to push mwcc over its keep-vs-rematerialise threshold: it parked the
 * constant 1 (the `one` field) in a callee-saved register so it could reuse it for the later
 * `flag = 1`, emitting `movne r5,r6` where the ROM emits `movne r5,#1`. That one decision then
 * rotated three registers through the whole tail and looked exactly like an allocator coin-flip.
 * With the correct single argument every register falls into place.
 *
 * The tell was that the phantom arguments were invisible: the values 0x625, obj->ext and kind are
 * ALSO stored into the descriptors right before the call, so they legitimately sit in r1/r2/r3 at
 * the branch and the disassembly looks identical either way. Only grepping the matched tree for
 * real `VEC_Mag(` call sites -- every one of them one-argument -- exposed it.
 *
 * Also load-bearing: the three tail stores must be written in the ROM's order
 * one(0x20) -> flag25(0x25) -> b10(0x10); the `t = reqB.flag25` read only has to precede its
 * write, so the b10 store goes last. */
