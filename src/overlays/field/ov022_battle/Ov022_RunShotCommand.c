/* Ov022_RunShotCommand -- carry out one packed shot command.
 *
 * The owner field picks the actor and the channel field one of its shot
 * channels; a command for an owner with no actor is dropped.
 *
 * Command 1 clears a shot's state, command 3 sets bit 0 of its flags -- both
 * index the channel's shots by the low byte of the fuse field -- and command 2
 * refills the channel's budget.
 *
 * Command 0 unpacks the rest of the command into a shot request on the stack
 * and, while the channel still has budget, hands it to the channel's spawn
 * handler with the command's mode. A spawn that reports success spends one
 * unit of budget, unless bit 0 of the chosen descriptor's flags says this shot
 * is free.
 *
 * Two shapes carry the original's codegen: the two direction halfwords are
 * copied as one two-byte-aligned pair, which is what loads both before either
 * is stored, and the whole of command 0 lives inside its own switch arm, which
 * is what leaves the other three arms out of line behind it.
