/* ov022: post the actor's contact packet, if the sender is listening.
 *
 * Builds a twenty-byte packet on the stack from the source record: its point,
 * two counters that always start at zero, and a packed word carrying the kind,
 * a fixed mode, and two ids of twelve and eight bits.
 *
 * The packed word is never initialised as a whole, only field by field, which
 * is why every one of its stores reads it back first.
