/* Answers whether a piece is one the peer should be told about.
 *
 * A piece has to be live, of a kind outside the five the walk skips, and clear
 * of both fit flags.  A negative range takes every piece that got this far;
 * otherwise the piece's home has to be at least that far from the point asked
 * about.
 *
 * Only the low byte of the state word is looked at -- an eight-bit field of
 * the halfword, which is why the ROM extracts it with a shift pair instead of
 * masking -- and the home vector is copied to the frame before the distance
 * call rather than passed in place.
 *
 * That copy is twelve bytes from +0xb0, and its last word is the halfword the
 * tree already calls the piece's home angle.  Either the angle is misplaced or
 * the distance is being taken against a z that is not one; the ROM copies the
 * three words either way, so this keeps the block whole and leaves the
 * question open.
