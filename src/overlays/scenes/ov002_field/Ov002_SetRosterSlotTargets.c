/* Refresh the live triple and the live value on all four roster slots.
 *
 * The slot array hangs off the session block at root context + 0x8bcc, whose entries pointer
 * sits at +4, so the array itself is reached through +0x8bd0. Slots are 0x44 apart and there
 * are always four. Each slot carries a default triple at +0 and a default value at +0xc,
 * written by Ov002_FillRosterSlotDefaults, alongside the live pair at +0x34 and +0x40 that this
 * function drives.
 *
 * A null pSrcVec means "use each slot's own default triple" and nValue == -1 means "use each
 * slot's own default value", so the (0, -1) call in the ov022 teardown path at
 * Ov022_EndSceneForEachPlayer restores every slot at once.
 *
 * Codegen note. The destination pointer is assigned redundantly in BOTH arms of the source
 * selection. Assigned once after the merge instead, mwcc forward-substitutes it away and hands
 * its register to the compiler's own struct-copy cursor; assigned once before the branch, it
 * survives but its two setup instructions are hoisted above the compare. Duplicated across the
 * arms mwcc sinks it back into the merge, which costs nothing and is where the ROM has it.
 * Declaring pDst before pSrc, and assigning pSrc before pDst inside each arm, fixes the last
 * register pair; pEntry must be declared at function scope.
 *
 * Ghidra carries this as Ov002_SetRosterSlotTargets over Ov002RosterSlot and VecFx32.
