/* Drive the dash: advance the travel accumulator by the owner's per-frame delta and, while it
 * is still within 0x7f8, re-issue the dash request with the number of steps scaled from how far
 * it has got (v * 0x3e66 / 0x7f8) plus the three canned direction vectors. Once the sub-object's
 * busy byte clears, switch to action 2 and drop the think callback.
 *
 * The request is ONE 0x38-byte struct built on the stack and passed by address; the three
 * globals are declared with the vector type so their copies come out as the ROM's ldm/stm pairs.
 * Matched byte-exact 2026-07-23, first compile. */
