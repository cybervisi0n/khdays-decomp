/*
 * Ov120_ChargeTowardTarget_Step -- Ov120_ChargeTowardTarget_Step.
 *
 * One frame of the charge that follows the seed timer (the caller at 020ccf08). Shared
 * byte-for-byte with ov121 and ov122; only the call targets differ.
 *
 * Re-acquire the target through the ov107 finder and keep it in the action state. With no
 * target, drop the owner into action state 2 and release the node's slot. Otherwise take the
 * aim vector owner->target, flatten it onto the ground plane, normalise it, and subtract both
 * radii to get the gap; the heading (atan2 of the flattened aim) goes to the state. A gap past
 * the owner's reach also gives up.
 *
 * Then build the facing direction from the sin/cos table indexed by the stored facing angle,
 * project the aim onto it (clamped at zero) and store that projection scaled by 0x300 as the
 * charge velocity. Once the gap closes below 0x800 the velocity is zeroed, and if the target is
 * also well in front (projection at or above 0xc00) the charge is finished. Failing that it ends
 * on the accumulated-time limit of 0x2000.
 *
 * Ghidra: Ov120_ChargeTowardTarget_Step(Ov120ActionNode *pNode), types /khdays/Ov120ActionNode,
 * /khdays/Ov120ActionState, /khdays/Ov120Actor, /khdays/Ov107LockTarget,
 * /khdays/SceneFrameClock and /khdays/Vec3.
 *
 * Byte-exact codegen notes (mwccarm 3.0/139):
 *  - THE TARGET IS READ TWICE THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT PATHS. The finder's result is stored
 *    straight into the state and used from there for VEC_Subtract; the radius later re-reads
 *    the field into a local. Holding the result in one local across both uses swaps the two
 *    callee-saved registers, because the local that is re-read has to be younger than the owner
 *    local for the allocator to pair it with the gap. Same crack the melee picker at 020ccd90
 *    records for its own two locals.
 *  - The two radii are subtracted target first, owner second, which is what fixes the load
 *    order of the two pointers.
 *  - The angle-to-index scale is the catalogued 64-bit form; it must stay one expression.
 *  - nElapsed40 is accumulated and compared in that order: the ROM stores the new value
 *    unconditionally and branches on it, which is what the single statement produces.
