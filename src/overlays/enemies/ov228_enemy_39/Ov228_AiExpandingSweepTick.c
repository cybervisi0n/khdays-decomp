/* Ov228_AiExpandingSweepTick -- drive the timed effect, then end the move.
 *
 * The timer at +0x4c runs to 0x7f8 and stops there (it is stored once raw and again clamped --
 * that double store is what the ROM emits). Once it has already reached 0x7f8 the whole effect is
 * skipped and only the ending runs.
 *
 * The effect is described by a 0x38-byte parameter block built on the stack and handed to
 * Ov228_ContactSweep: the object's own vector from ctx+0x34, three constant vectors, a scaled
 * progress value, and a 1.
 *
 * The progress is `clamp(timer, 0, 0x3b8) * 0x6000 / 0x3b8` -- 0x3b8 (952) is both the clamp
 * ceiling and the divisor (read off the 0x44d72045 / asr #8 magic), so this normalises the timer
 * onto 0..0x6000. Kept unfolded because the intermediate product overflows nothing but the
 * multiply-then-magic-divide is what the ROM does.
 *
 * data_02042258/64/70 sit 12 bytes apart, i.e. three consecutive VecFx32 constants -- note the
 * block takes them out of order (70, 58, 64). */
