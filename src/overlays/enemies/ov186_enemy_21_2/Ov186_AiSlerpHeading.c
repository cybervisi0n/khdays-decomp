/* Ov186_AiSlerpHeading -- AI think tick: step the spline, push it to the render node, and while the
 * actor is in reaction state 2 or 4 advance its heading and drift.
 *
 * The heading step is `timer * 8` mapped through the Q12 sin/cos table at data_0203d210 (indexed
 * by the reciprocal-multiply of 0x28be60db9391), its sample divided by 25 and accumulated into
 * +0x30. The tail resets the state's own position vector from the shared zero vector at
 * data_02041dc8 and copies the previous one to the render node, advancing the state pointer with
 * a post-indexed load.
 *
 * Three things are load-bearing:
 *  - the field at +0 of the state block is the owner ADDRESS, not a pointer to it; modelling it as
 *    `int *` costs an extra `ldr` at each of the four uses.
 *  - the tail vector comes from data_02041dc8. Reading it from data_0203d210 (which the old note
 *    did) makes the two pool loads share one word and the literal pool comes out four bytes short.
 *  - the timer update is a compound assignment USED AS A VALUE, `sum = (mid->f3c += delta)`.
 *    Split into `sum = ...; mid->f3c = sum;` mwcc hoists the following literal-pool load one slot
 *    above the shift.
 * Byte-identical twin of Ov117_AiSlerpHeading. */
