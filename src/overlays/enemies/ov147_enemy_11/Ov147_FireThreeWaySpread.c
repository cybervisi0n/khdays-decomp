/* Fire a three-way spread from the owner's heading.
 *
 * Turn the Q12 radian at self+0x34 into a sin/cos table index (see
 * Ov137_PickApproachDir for the full write-up of that conversion), build the unit XZ
 * direction from it, then rotate it +0x860 and walk it back down in 0x860 steps: the
 * three nodes at owner+0x398 are launched at +0x860, 0 and -0x860 around the heading.
 * The caller's `height` is written into the direction's Y before each launch, so the
 * rotation only ever acts on the flat XZ part.
 *
 * The second rotation quaternion is built ONCE, before the loop, with the negated angle,
 * and re-applied between launches -- so the last iteration deliberately skips it.
 *
 * TWO CODEGEN POINTS, both about things that look like scheduling and are not:
 *  - DECLARATION ORDER sets the stack layout.  The ROM has the direction at sp+0 and the
 *    quaternion at sp+0xc; mwcc gives the LOWER address to the LATER declaration, so the
 *    Xform must be declared before the VecFx32.  Declared the other way the whole frame is
 *    mirrored and every access offset is wrong.
 *  - the node index must stay a displacement: `(char *)*self + i * sizeof(int)` with the
 *    +0x398 applied at the access.  Folding the base in as `((int *)(*self + 0x398))[i]`
 *    costs a register for the byte offset (`add r0, r0, r6` instead of the ROM's
 *    `add r0, r0, r4, lsl #2`), which spills into an EIGHTH callee-saved register and an
 *    extra push -- 12 bytes.  Same lever as the Tally families.
