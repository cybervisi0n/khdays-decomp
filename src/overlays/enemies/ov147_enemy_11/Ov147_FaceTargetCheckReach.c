/*
 * Face the target and drop to idle when close enough (x4).
 *
 * Aim vector owner->target, hand it to BuildHeadingRotation (020d0764) to point the node at the
 * target, then normalise the aim for the distance: if the distance minus the owner radius
 * (owner+0x80) is under 0x2000, the target is in reach -> state 2 and advance.
 *
 * MATCHED. Two catalogued spellings, both about how a vector crosses the ABI:
 *  - ★ `ldm`-ARG COALESCING: the aim vector is passed to BuildHeadingRotation as a STRUCT BY VALUE
 *    (`VecFx32` -> three register args), which makes mwcc load the three words with a single
 *    `ldm` -- exactly the ROM's `ldm r1,{r1,r2,r3}`. Passing them as three separate `int` args
 *    (`f(state, aim[0], aim[1], aim[2], 0)`) emits three `ldr`s instead and is one instruction
 *    off. This is the deferred-ties "ldm-args coalescing" entry, and struct-by-value is the crack
 *    for it -- the callee still receives three register args, same ABI.
 *  - `owner = *state` is loaded BEFORE the normalise call, so it survives in a callee-saved
 *    register (r6, hence `push {r4,r5,r6,lr}`), and the state-2 store RE-READS *state fresh. Read
 *    after the call instead, mwcc keeps one copy and drops the reload (128 B) -- but the ROM
 *    holds owner across the call and re-reads, so the C must too.
