/*
 * Opens the ring-burst action.
 *
 * Sets the actor's ring flags, clears the pose gate, then places the four bone
 * attachments evenly around the anchor: every idle bone is picked up, given
 * state 5, told through its hook, and moved to the anchor offset by the sin and
 * cos of its share of the circle, with a hold timer of 0x800.  Finally the ring
 * event is raised and the node is handed to the follow-up action.
 *
 * The running angle is in fixed-point radians, so the table index is the angle
 * times one over two pi, done as a 48-bit multiply.  The accumulator is
 * unsigned and the quarter is taken through a signed reinterpretation: with a
 * plain signed accumulator the compiler proves it never goes negative and drops
 * the rounding out of the division entirely.
 *
 * The index variable holds the already doubled entry number rather than the
 * entry itself.  The table is an array of shorts read in pairs, so doubling at
 * the point of use instead would let the compiler fold both scalings into one
 * shift; keeping the doubled value is what produces the two chained shifts the
 * ROM has, and it also keeps the two pool constants hoisted out of the loop.
