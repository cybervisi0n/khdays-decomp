/*
 * Camera_CommitMatrices - build the projection and view matrices for a camera actor and
 * cache its source vectors, called from Game_UpdateObjectMotion (state 0 commits the
 * object's base transform block at obj+4).
 *
 * Steps:
 *  - Camera_BuildProjectionMtx builds the perspective/projection matrix into data_0204739c from the
 *    actor's projection inputs (the four words at +0x00, the near/far bound at +0x10, and
 *    the fixed FX32_ONE scale 0x1000);
 *  - clears GX dirty bits 0x50 in the camera flags word;
 *  - caches the eye/up/target vectors (actor +0x20 / +0x2c / +0x14) into the global camera
 *    state (data_020475ac / b8 / c4);
 *  - MTX_LookAt = MTX_LookAt(&pos, &up, &target, data_020473e0) builds the view matrix;
 *  - clears GX dirty bits 0xe8.
 *
 * ARM. Codegen note: Camera_BuildProjectionMtx takes the four projection words as SEPARATE scalar
 * arguments, not as one 16-byte struct passed by value. That distinction drives the whole
 * basic block's list scheduler: with the scalar form the two look-at address computes
 * (add for +0x2c and +0x14) cluster together before the second vector copy and the view
 * matrix's pool word is loaded last, exactly as the ROM does. A struct-by-value first
 * argument (which loads the four words with a single ldm into r0-r3) perturbs the schedule
 * and reorders the three-vector copy block by ~7 instructions. The three cached vectors are
 * modelled as fields of one camera-state struct so mwcc keeps them a single aliasing region
 * (separate globals batch the two destination pool loads and mis-order the block).
